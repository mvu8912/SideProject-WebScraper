2.  Technology Stack: 2.1. Programming Language: Perl 2.2. Database Management System: PostgreSQL 2.3. Web Scraping Libraries: Beautiful Soup (via Perl equivalent such as Mojo::DOM or Web::Scraper), Selenium 2.4. Email Library: Email::Sender (Perl Library) 2.5. Web Framework: Dancer2 or Mojolicious 2.6. Data Analysis Libraries: PDL (Perl Data Language) 2.7. Version Control: Git 2.8. Containerization: Docker 2.9. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Jenkins

3.  Design Goals: 3.1. Modularity: Ensure that the application is modular with clear separation of concerns to facilitate ease of development, testing, and maintenance. 3.2. Scalability: Design the application to handle an increasing amount of work by adding resources to the system to manage increased load. 3.3. Usability: Ensure that the application is user-friendly with intuitive interfaces that allow users to effectively complete their tasks. 3.4. Performance: Ensure high performance in data scraping, analysis, and other functionalities to provide real-time or near real-time insights. 3.5. Security: Implement proper security measures to protect data and ensure privacy. 3.6. Extendibility: Design the system in such a way that new features can be added with minimal disruption to existing functionalities.

4.  System Architecture: 4.1. Client-Side:

    -   Implement a user-friendly web interface using a Perl web framework like Dancer2 or Mojolicious. 4.2. Server-Side:
    -   Utilize Perl for server-side scripting to manage data scraping, analysis, and other core functionalities. 4.3. Database:
    -   Utilize PostgreSQL for data storage, retrieval, and management. 4.4. Data Scraping Module:
    -   Implement data scraping using Perl equivalents to Beautiful Soup such as Mojo::DOM or Web::Scraper, and Selenium for browser automation. 4.5. Analysis Module:
    -   Utilize PDL (Perl Data Language) for data analysis and prediction. 4.6. Notification Module:
    -   Use Email::Sender Perl library for email notifications.
5.  Database Design: 5.1. Data Entities:

    -   URLs, Platforms, Collected Data, Analyzed Data, Users, Exported Data, Lead Information, Sentiment Scores, etc. 5.2. Relationships:
    -   Define the relationships between the various data entities ensuring normalization to eliminate redundancy and dependency. 5.3. Indexes:
    -   Create necessary indexes to optimize search and retrieval operations.
6.  User Interface Design:

    -   Develop wireframes and mock-ups for the user interface, ensuring it is intuitive and user-friendly.
7.  Testing: 7.1. Unit Testing:

    -   Use Perl testing libraries to write unit tests for individual modules. 7.2. Integration Testing:
    -   Test the interaction between different modules to ensure they work together as expected. 7.3. System Testing:
    -   Test the entire system as a whole to ensure it meets the specified requirements. 7.4. Performance Testing:
    -   Test the system's performance to ensure it meets the design goals under various conditions.
8.  Deployment:

    -   Utilize Docker for containerization to ensure a consistent environment across development, testing, and production. Implement a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins for streamlined deployment and updates.
9.  Maintenance:

    -   Plan for routine maintenance to ensure the system remains up-to-date and continues to meet the design goals and requirements.
10. Appendices:

    -   None
